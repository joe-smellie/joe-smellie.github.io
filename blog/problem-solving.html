            <p>I’ll tell you about a time I was blocked on a simple problem...</p>
            <p>
                If I’m honest most of this week has felt like a bit of a problem. At times the kata challenges werel an absolute nightmare. Although it was a struggle, it wasn’t all bad and I had to use many problem-solving techniques to achieve positive results. It was nice to be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Even though it took longer than I would have liked.

                The first example of this was super-fizzbuzz, I fell into a false sense of security after completing fizzbuzz relatively easily. The simplest thing I couldn’t work out was how to call the fizzbuzz function within the super-fizzbuzz function. What followed was a couple of hours of grafting, I utilized psudeocode, trying a lot of things, Rubber ducky, reading error messages, console-logging and googling. I finally asked for some guidance on discord and received some good advice on where to start. I woke up the next day then worked it out within 5 minutes. Shout out to .map().

                As mentioned earlier, this week has been by far the hardest week so far, with not much coming too easy. So many problems were solved. I think I solved many elegantly. In gradebook, I feel like I utilized console.log() really well and reading the error messages. After trying a few things and reading plenty of articles online I felt more confident in decoding the errors and understood where I had gone wrong. It turned out to be an easy fix/simple error.

                Regarding problem-solving techniques, I feel confident using the majority of them. My favourites are Rubber Ducky, Trying Something, Console.logging, Reading error messages and Googling. I need to get better at asking for help, reflecting on this week, I spent a lot of time in purgatory where if I had asked earlier, I perhaps could have been more productive. I think it’s about finding a balance. Life goes on and I’m looking forward to continuing this journey.
