It involves the brain's capacity to form new neural connections, rewire existing ones, and adjust its structure and function.</p>

            <p>Personally, this exploration didn't necessarily suprise me as it is something I have researched and implemented for many years. The best way to put it is that it was a nice reminder! I feel as though I have already implemented this mindset in my learning journey through positive self talk, focussing on the process not the outcome and endeavouring to stay on the path when things get tough</p>
            <p>There is one part in the video above that I loved - Not yet! But I'll let you watch that for yourself</p>
