            <p>The Te Whare Tapa Whā approach to health and wellbeing was developed in 1984 by leading Māori health advocate Sir Mason Durie.</p>

            <p>Incorporating all aspects of hauora, this approach provides a holistic model of health which showcases the interconnectedness of all parts of our lives and the people in it. Describing health as a wharenui/meeting house with four walls, each pillar relates to a different aspect of hauora: taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing), taha hinengaro (mental/emotional wellbeing), taha tinana (physical wellbeing), and taha whānau (family and social wellbeing).</p>
            <p>This is my wellbeing plan using the Te Whare Tapa Whā model</p>

            <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
            <p>Maintain my regular exercise routine - Gym daily, cardio 4x a week</p>
            <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
            <p>Maintain communication with my family - Catch up on the phone daily</p>
            <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
            <p>Meditate daily</p>
            <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
            <p>Daily practice of gratitude</p>
            <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
            <p>Weekly trip to the beach to see the ocean</p>
