            <p>Who am I?</p>
            <p>If I’m honest, not too long ago this question would have completely rattled me, my internal dialogue would have been uncertain and most likely defensive. But now I feel comfortable answering who, and why, I am who I am. Maybe that’s growth? I’m not sure but I’ll claim it.</p>
            <p>I’ve been extremely lucky to be surrounded by great people throughout my life, and by that, I mean my family to who I am very close to. We lost dad about a year ago, which was the worst. He was such a legend, my biggest supporter, biggest critic and best mate. But we were very lucky to have him.</p>
            <p>I learnt from dad always to be nice to people, back yourself and not be afraid to have a punt (both literally and metaphorically). I really value people and the relationships I hold and am very empathetic. I feel as though I got that from the old fella.</p>
            <p>My mum is also a legend, she taught me the value of hard work and balance in life. Whatever you want to achieve you can achieve. I mean, I think her story is really inspiring – from a young single mum, mental health nurse to CEO. Stick to your guns and be sure that whatever you want to do or are doing aligns with your values.</p>
            <p>Strength wise, I’m positive, adaptable, curious and resilient. I believe these qualities will assist me on my journey at Dev Academy. Especially when things become difficult.</p>
            <p>A potential limitation of my learning and career development. When I was out for a run the other morning and thought to myself that growing up, I got a lot of praise, and as an adult I’ve struggled at times when praise hasn’t been easy to come by. This has led me to be hypercritical of myself. I realise now that I need to be clear on my own definition of success rather than relying on the approval of others.</p>
            <p>I can also be hyper obsessive regarding things, a good example of this is exercise. I can’t just get into ‘shape’ I need to be the fittest, strongest, healthiest I’ve ever been. This means I’m highly regimented with routine and diet. Sometimes going to the gym twice a day. I think I strive for perfection. I identify that this could be a potential limitation on my learning as it directly transfers to what I’m doing now - potentially spending hours on something that could take 10min to make sure it looks perfect.</p>
            <p>As a cricket coach I am often met with challenges surrounding productivity and making difficult decisions. I like to believe that all decisions I make are aligned to mine and whoever I’m working withs values, be it a team or an individual. If you are open, adaptable and can seek understanding in a non-confrontational way, people can progress forward in harmony.</p>
