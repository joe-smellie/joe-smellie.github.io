            I honestly can’t believe we are at the end of Foundations, for me it’s honestly flown by which is both awesome and terrifying at the same time. I’ve really enjoyed the Core Skills aspect of the course, from Neuroplasticity to Emotional Intelligence and beyond. Here’s my take so far:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Three new things I have learnt about myself</strong> and ego due to the core learning. It’s interesting because many of the principles we covered throughout I was familiar with. So, I’m not sure whether these are learnings or confirmation of things I already knew about myself, but even if it is this way it’s good to have it front of mind. 
        </p>
        <div class="bloglist">
        <ul>
            <li>I need to stay aware of my internal voice.</li>
            <li>I’m proud and can be reluctant to ask for help.</li>
            <li>I can fluctuate between a fixed and growth mindset.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>  
        <p>
            <strong>The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming.</strong> What’s mad is that prior to this course I would have never considered these things when thinking about programming. I believe that self-awareness plays a huge part in life overall, in relation to learning and programming it plays a significant role. By being self-aware, one can truly understand where they are in terms of content and their ability to use the skills they have learnt. All three are important when working with others, learning and programming in a lot of ways is like a team sport and it’s important to be able to relate well with others to achieve.
        </p>

            <strong>What surprised me the most about the core learning</strong> was how much I enjoyed it. My favourite topics were Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset. The video on my blog - Carol Dweck not yet is gold and I’m very happy I found it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The most challenging part of core learning</strong> is probably being vulnerable and writing blog posts to then share with others. This has got easier however and through these exercises I have built some positive routines. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I think we spend a lot of time focusing on core learning</strong> in a web development Bootcamp course because what we are currently undertaking is hard, it’s stressful and time moves fast! The skills that we are learning set us up for success in not only the course but in our careers and lives after. I’m grateful for the core aspects of this course.
