          <h2>My Learning Plan.</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan: 19 April 2024.</h3>
            <div id="list"> 
              <ol>
                <li><strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong></li>
                    <p>
                      My long term goal is the same. To be happy and fulfilled in my career. Following my time at Dev Academy I hope to have obtained the technical and personal skills to achieve a sustainable career within the tech industry where I can continue to grow and develop. 
                    </p>
                <li><strong>What do you think your strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp.</strong></li>
                    <p>
                      This is very similar to my answers in Foundations. Strengths: Positive, adaptable, curious and resilient. Limitations: Overthinking, hyper-critical and perfectionism.
                    </p>
                <li><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></li>
                    <p>
                      My internal voice and comparing myself to others. I need to remain self aware that this is my journey, not anyone elses. High expectations of myself, need to ensure I stay realistic and kind.
                    </p>
                <li><strong>What non-technical - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></li>
                    <p>
                      Again, very similar. Planning, time management I'd like to continue the routines I've started in foundations e.g journaling. But overall confidence in myself 
                    </p>
                <li><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong></li>
                    <p>
                      This is the same as my foundations answer, I expect the facilitation team to be open, knowledgeable and friendly. Foundations was great. I just expect the team to be keen and helpful. Wouldn't mind the odd check in to see how I'm going.
                    </p>
                <li><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</strong></li>
                    <p>
                      My expectations of myself on Bootcamp. I just expect myself to do absolutely everything I can to come out the other side on a good note. I expect myself to stay present and focus on processes rather than outcomes. In the programming world, I'm a baby now, I will be a child at the end of bootcamp. It's a marathon not a sprint. I will ask for help when I need it.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                      I expect myself to stay commited to my routines and ensure I'm aware of my Te Whare Tapa Whā. Finally, I expect myself to be a good team mate, supportive to others and their learning journey. 
                    </p>
