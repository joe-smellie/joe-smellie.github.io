            <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
                <p>My long term goal is to be happy and fulfilled in my career. Following my time at Dev Academy I hope to have obtained the technical and personal skills to achieve a sustainable career within the tech industry where I can continue to grow and develop. Outside of this I want to continue to coach cricket and maintain balance within my life.</p>
            <li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li>
                <p>Strengths: Positive, adaptable, curious and resilient.</p>
                <p>Limitations: Overthinking, hyper-critical and perfectionism</p>
            <li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
                <p>Planning, time management</p>
            <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</li>
                <p>I commit to building a sustainable routine which I stand by. I commit to being a good teammate, friend and support to other learners. I commit to be an engaged student who is open to making mistakes and learn from them fast and grow.</p>
                <p>When things are building up and I become frustrated, I commit to taking breaks, exercise regularly and be kind to myself and others.</p>
            <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
                <p>I expect the facilitation team to be open, knowledgeable and friendly.</p>
            <li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</li>
